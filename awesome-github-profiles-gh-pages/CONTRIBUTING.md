## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

After forking, clone your repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/awesome-github-profiles.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Switch to the `gh-pages` Branch

Since the main code is in the `gh-pages` branch, navigate to that branch after cloning:

```bash
cd awesome-github-profiles
git checkout gh-pages
```

### 4. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```

Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `add-new-profile`, `fix-readme-typo`).

### 5. Make Your Changes

Make the necessary changes in your local repository. Follow the project's coding style and guidelines to ensure consistency.

### 6. Test Your Changes

If applicable, test your changes locally to ensure nothing breaks. This can include:

- Running the project to verify functionality.
- Running tests if the project includes any testing tools.

### 7. Stage and Commit Your Changes

Once your changes are made, stage the files you want to commit:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit your changes with a clear message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add new profile"  # Be specific about what changes were made.
```

### 8. Push to Your Fork

Push your new branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

### 9. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Navigate to the original repository on GitHub, and you should see an option to create a Pull Request. Click that and fill in the necessary details:

- Reference any issue your PR addresses (e.g., "Closes #123").
- Explain clearly what your changes do.

After submitting your PR, the maintainers will review it. You may receive feedback or requests for changes, so keep an eye on the comments.
